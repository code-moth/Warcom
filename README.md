                      Copyright 1991, 2004 David Eubanks

This program was written as a companion to War Law, a Rolemaster system for large scale fantasy combat from Iron Crown Enterprises, originally published in 1991, and now long out-of-print.

It is released here in source code form with the permission of its' author.

It needs some serious updating to give it a modern user interface, but you could probably get it to run as-is (after compilation) in a Virtual Machine with a bit of effort.
